**The Gradient** is my notebook of AI research notes—concise summaries with practitioner insights.

I’m a Senior Staff Data Scientist in Australia. I read papers on **LLMs, agentic systems, safety/oversight, evaluation, and MLOps** and extract what matters: methods, numbers, and implications for production systems in regulated environments.

**How I summarize**  
- ≤180-word executive summary  
- Bullet takeaways with concrete metrics  
- Structured sections (Background → Methods → Results → Implications → Limitations)  
- Links to the original paper

Feedback and paper suggestions welcome!
