**The Gradient** is my notebook of AI research notes—concise summaries with practitioner insights.

I’m a Senior Staff Data Scientist in Australia. I read papers on **LLMs, agentic systems, safety/oversight, evaluation, and MLOps** and extract what matters: methods, numbers, and implications for production systems in regulated environments.

Feedback and paper suggestions welcome!
