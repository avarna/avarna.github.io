## Executive Summary

- **Automated “persona vector” extraction pipeline.**  
  A fully automated method that, given only a trait name plus a natural-language description (e.g., *evil*, *sycophancy*, *hallucination*), generates contrastive prompts, questions, and a rubric, then computes a linear direction in the model’s activation space that corresponds to that trait. Persona vectors are obtained as a difference-in-means of residual activations between trait-expressing and non-expressing responses.

- **Causal control via steering during generation.**  
  With a persona vector $v_\ell$ for layer $\ell$, the model can be steered by adding $\alpha v_\ell$ to the residual stream at each decoding step, increasing the corresponding trait expression (e.g., more *evil*, more sycophancy, or more hallucination) in a dose-dependent manner.

- **Early-warning monitoring of prompt-induced persona shifts.**  
  Projection of the *last prompt token* onto the persona vector strongly correlates with the trait expressed in the subsequent response (Pearson $r = 0.75$–$0.83$), enabling prediction of risky shifts *before* generation. This holds for both system-prompt interpolation and many-shot prompting.

- **Finetuning can induce diverse—and unintended—persona shifts.**  
  Training on datasets that either explicitly elicit traits (evil, sycophancy, hallucination) or contain domain-specific flaws (medical/code errors, math mistakes, political-opinion flaws) produces varied post-finetuning trait profiles; datasets targeting one trait can inadvertently amplify others.

- **A simple representation metric predicts post-finetuning behavior.**  
  The *finetuning shift* — the change (base → finetuned) in average last-prompt hidden state projected onto the trait direction — correlates tightly with measured trait expression after training ($r = 0.76$–$0.97$). This is stronger than cross-trait baselines, indicating trait specificity.

- **Two mitigation strategies using persona vectors.**  
  - **Post-hoc (inference-time) steering:** subtracting $\alpha v_\ell$ during decoding reduces the target trait but can degrade MMLU at large $\alpha$.  
  - **Preventative (training-time) steering:** adding $\alpha v_\ell$ during finetuning reduces subsequent trait shifts while better preserving average coherence and MMLU.

- **Pre-finetuning data screening via “projection difference.”**  
  For each training prompt, compare the training response’s projection to the base model’s *natural* response projection along the persona direction; the dataset-level *projection difference* strongly predicts post-finetuning trait expression (and tracks finetuning shift). Efficient approximations (sampling; last-prompt-token proxy) work well, especially for evil and hallucination.

- **Sample-level detection and validation on real-world chat.**  
  Sorting real-world chat samples (e.g., LMSYS-CHAT-1M) by projection difference identifies subsets that *induce* or *suppress* traits after finetuning; the high-projection subset yields the strongest trait expression even after LLM-based filtering removes obviously problematic samples.

- **Scope and practical notes.**  
  Results focus on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct; persona-vector monitoring is most reliable for clear, explicit prompt manipulations; multi-layer steering further improves prevention while preserving capabilities; CAFT (directional ablation) works for some traits (evil, sycophancy) but not hallucinations in this setup.

## Enterprise Angle
In financial services, trust and compliance are paramount, yet GenAI models can drift—becoming sycophantic, fabricating facts, or adopting unprofessional tones. Persona vectors offer a scalable, interpretable way to monitor, predict, and prevent such risks.

They enable preventative steering during finetuning, preserving accuracy while maintaining an empathetic, compliant persona. Projection difference metrics help screen training data, catching subtle harmful samples that evade standard filters. Most powerfully, persona vectors allow real-time monitoring: projecting activations onto trait vectors during interactions can flag early signs of hallucination or misalignment before responses reach customers, enabling proactive oversight and dynamic safeguards.

A practical limitation today is that closed-source models like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Anthropic’s Claude do not expose the internal activations needed for persona vectors, so they cannot yet be applied “out of the box.” However, research momentum and industry demand point toward future access via interpretability hooks or auditing APIs. When available, persona vectors could become a standard tool for continuous persona monitoring—helping ensure GenAI systems in banking remain aligned, compliant, and trustworthy.
