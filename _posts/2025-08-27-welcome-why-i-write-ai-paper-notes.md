**Why “The Gradient”?**  
Because modern AI moves fast—and the *slope* of learning depends on how efficiently we extract signal from papers. This blog is my working notebook: short, structured summaries of research I read, with pragmatic takeaways.

### What to expect
- **Executive summaries** in ≤180 words  
- **Main takeaways** as bullets with numbers when possible  
- **Structured notes** (Background → Methods → Results → Implications → Limitations)  
- Occasional **banking/enterprise** angle where relevant (risk, compliance, monitoring, MLOps)

### What I won’t do
- Hype without evidence  
- Wall-of-text summaries with no structure  
- Uncited claims

If you have a paper you want me to cover, ping me on LinkedIn or open an issue on the repo. Let’s keep the signal high and the variance low.
